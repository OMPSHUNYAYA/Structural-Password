Shunyaya Structural Password (SSP)

Permission

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization to use,
implement, reproduce, publish, distribute, reference, or incorporate this Standard,
in whole or in part, without restriction.

This permission applies to commercial and non-commercial use.

No registration required.
No fees.
No approval required.

No Restrictions

This Open Standard imposes no legal, technical, or commercial restrictions on use
or implementation.

Attribution is not required.
No endorsement or certification is implied.
No runtime obligations apply.

Correctness is governed by structural conformance, not licensing terms.

Recommended Attribution (Optional)

Attribution is recommended but not required.

If provided, the preferred form is:

“Implements the Shunyaya Structural Password (SSP) concepts.”

Attribution must not imply endorsement by the authors or the Shunyaya framework.

Scope

Shunyaya Structural Password (SSP) defines a deterministic structural identity and
execution-admissibility standard.

Identity and execution legitimacy are verified through exact structural reproduction,
without reliance on:

- stored secrets
- probabilistic matching
- tolerance or similarity thresholds
- time windows

The governing invariant is:

phi((m, a, s)) = m

Conformance

SSP defines exactly three outcomes:

ACCEPT
REJECT
ABSTAIN

Acceptance is defined as:

ACCEPT iff sig(T(m')) = sig(T(m))

Any implementation that introduces randomness, tolerance, similarity thresholds,
or probabilistic acceptance does not conform to the SSP Open Standard.

Independent implementations are permitted and encouraged.

Relationship to Other Licenses

This Open Standard applies only to the SSP specification and its normative
definitions.

Reference implementations, example tooling, or auxiliary materials may be
released under separate licenses if explicitly stated.

Responsibility

Use of SSP in operational, governance, or safety-critical contexts is undertaken
entirely at the user’s own responsibility.

SSP provides structural admissibility discipline, not authority, guarantees,
or enforcement.

No Warranty

THE STANDARD IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES,
OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS STANDARD.

Closing

Shunyaya Structural Password (SSP) is an Open Standard to maximize interoperability,
adoption, auditability, and correctness.

It is governed by structure — not permission.
