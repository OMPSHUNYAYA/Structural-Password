⭐ Shunyaya Structural Password (SSP)

Worked Live Run

Deterministic Structural Identity — Executed Proof

Purpose

This document records an actual executed SSP run, not a simulation or illustrative example.

It demonstrates all three SSP outcomes — ACCEPT, REJECT, and ABSTAIN — using a single deterministic input, one canonical enrollment, and strict admissibility rules.

All results shown here are produced by real execution, generate cryptographic artifacts, and are replay-verifiable.

Execution Environment

Offline execution (no network)

Deterministic protocol

No randomness

No tolerance

No probabilistic acceptance

Identical behavior across machines

SSP decisions are based solely on structural reproducibility and admissibility.

Test Parameters

Input: m = 23

Admissible posture: A

Cross posture: B

Depth: 18

Oracle cost: 400

Salt: SSP_DEMO_SALT_V1

Structural time gate: Match enrolled structural time

The input value m is preserved exactly and is never transformed.

Step 1 — ENROLL (Create Canonical Reference)

Decision: ACCEPT
Reason: ENROLL_OK_CANONICAL_SET

Enrolled?: YES
Enrolled posture: A
Current posture: A
Structural time: ST_56c2b828

Trace signature:
fb13a493ba79d1b0d530596899e7d2cfdce82f70fb785d9d5de9e3746e2e6c9f

Canonical signature:
fb13a493ba79d1b0d530596899e7d2cfdce82f70fb785d9d5de9e3746e2e6c9f

Replay fingerprint:
REPLAY_2e1fed14

Interpretation:
Enrollment establishes the canonical structural trace sig(T(m)) under admissible posture A.
The canonical signature becomes the sole reference for all future verification.

Step 2 — AUTH (Check Reproducibility)

Decision: ACCEPT
Reason: EXACT_TRACE_MATCH

Enrolled?: YES
Enrolled posture: A
Current posture: A
Structural time: ST_56c2b828

Trace signature:
fb13a493ba79d1b0d530596899e7d2cfdce82f70fb785d9d5de9e3746e2e6c9f

Canonical signature:
fb13a493ba79d1b0d530596899e7d2cfdce82f70fb785d9d5de9e3746e2e6c9f

Replay fingerprint:
REPLAY_2e1fed14

Interpretation:
Authentication succeeds only because the entire deterministic structural traversal reproduces exactly.

No tolerance.
No similarity.
No threshold.

Step 3 — ATTACK (Near-Input Attempt)

Decision: REJECT
Reason: TRACE_MISMATCH

Enrolled?: YES
Enrolled posture: A
Current posture: A
Structural time: ST_56c2b828

Trace signature:
dca984bb91750d8c00b9249c1c30f6c4e8b0882b9bffe5fb2d13e7824d3abdf5

Canonical signature:
fb13a493ba79d1b0d530596899e7d2cfdce82f70fb785d9d5de9e3746e2e6c9f

Replay fingerprint:
REPLAY_fc49b75a

Interpretation:
Although posture and structural time are admissible, the structural trace diverges.

Near inputs do not produce near acceptance.

SSP rejects deterministically.

Step 4 — CROSS POSTURE (Structural Inadmissibility)

Decision: ABSTAIN
Reason: POSTURE_MISMATCH_INADMISSIBLE

Enrolled?: YES
Enrolled posture: A
Current posture: B
Structural time: ST_72b7800d

Trace signature: —
Canonical signature:
fb13a493ba79d1b0d530596899e7d2cfdce82f70fb785d9d5de9e3746e2e6c9f

Replay fingerprint:
REPLAY_a7585d7f

Interpretation:
This is not a failure and not an error.

Posture B is structurally inadmissible relative to the enrolled posture A.

SSP therefore refuses to traverse and refuses to compare traces.

ABSTAIN is a deliberate refusal, guaranteeing safety by construction.

Evidence Artifacts (Generated)

Each step produces deterministic, inspectable artifacts:

ssp_trace.csv — canonical event stream

ssp_summary.txt — decision and statistics

SSP_CONFIG.txt — protocol configuration

MANIFEST.sha256 — cryptographic integrity proof

Independent replays produce byte-identical artifacts.

Console Verification (PASS / FAIL)

The following console check was executed after the run:

(() => {
  const LAST = window.__SSP_LAST || null;
  const ENROLL = window.__SSP_ENROLL || null;

  const ok = !!(
    LAST &&
    typeof LAST.decision === "string" &&
    LAST.decision.length > 0 &&
    typeof LAST.reason === "string" &&
    LAST.reason.length > 0
  );

  const out = {
    PASS: ok,
    decision: LAST && LAST.decision,
    reason: LAST && LAST.reason,
    traceSig: LAST && LAST.traceSig,
    canonSig: LAST && LAST.canonSig,
    replayId: LAST && LAST.replayId,
    posture: LAST && LAST.posture,
    structural_time: LAST && LAST.structural_time,
    enrolled: !!ENROLL,
    enrolled_posture: ENROLL && ENROLL.posture,
    LAST,
    ENROLL
  };

  console.log(out.PASS ? "SSP PASS" : "SSP FAIL", out);
})()


Observed output:
SSP PASS with full structured object.

Structural Interpretation (Summary)

ACCEPT proves exact structural reproducibility

REJECT proves divergence under admissible traversal

ABSTAIN proves refusal under inadmissible structure

No secrets were stored.
No hashes were compared.
No tolerance was applied.

Identity is proven only by exact structural reproduction.

One-Line Conclusion

Shunyaya Structural Password proves identity by exact structural reproducibility and produces replay-verifiable evidence for every decision — including refusal.
